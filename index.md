# About Me

I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University. I was previously an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, and the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University.

My research has appeared in the *American Political Science Review*, the *American Journal of Political Science*, *Political Analysis*, and other peer-reviewed journals. I teach undergraduate courses in American politics, comparative politics, and political methodology and graduate courses in quantitative methods.

I publicly version-control all of my working papers, so you can browse the bleeding-edge of my projects (manuscripts, data, and code) and courses on [GitHub](https://github.com/carlislerainey). I upload my talks to [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/carlislerainey) and I have a page on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=otXLf3wAAAAJ&hl=en). To keep up with my latest work, [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carlislerainey).
