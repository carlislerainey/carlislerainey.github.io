## Other things from me

- You can find several relevant blog posts on the topic [here](https://www.carlislerainey.com/blog/).  
- "Arguing for a Negligible Effect" [[PDF](https://www.carlislerainey.com/papers/nme.pdf)] describes how you can use an equivalence test to argue *in favor* of "no effect."
- "Substantive Importance and the Veil of Statistical Significance" [[PDF](https://www.carlislerainey.com/papers/meaningful.pdf)] makes a more general argument about how we should test claims.

And the code to compute power is here:

```
# mean and sd
true_effect <- 1.00
se <- 0.4

# compute power
pnorm(1.64*se,             # want fraction above* 1.64 SE
      mean = true_effect,  # mean of sampling distribution
      sd = se,             # sd of sampling distribution
      lower.tail = FALSE)  # fraction above, not below
```

## Other relevant papers

Here are the articles worth reading if you want to learn more:

-   @arel-bundock2022 for an argument that political scientists need to think harder about statistical power.

-   @bloom1995 on the simple and effective concept of "minimum detectable effects."

-   @lakens2022 for a clear and complete description of how researchers can justify their sample size using power analysis and other arguments.

-   @blair2019 for a comprehensive way of thinking about power along with research designs and their implications much more generally.
