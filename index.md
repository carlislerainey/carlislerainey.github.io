# About Me

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University. I was previously an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, and a graduate student in the Department of Political Science and the Department of Statistics at Florida State University.

My research has appeared in the *American Political Science Review*, the *American Journal of Political Science*, and other peer-reviewed journals. I teach undergraduate courses in American politics, comparative politics, and political methodology and graduate courses in quantitative methods.

I publicly version-control all of my working papers, so you can browse the bleeding-edge of my projects (manuscripts, data, and code) and courses on [GitHub](https://github.com/carlislerainey). I upload my research projects to [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/carlislerainey).
