And the code to compute power is here:

```
# mean and sd
true_effect <- 1.00
se <- 0.4

# compute power
pnorm(1.64*se,             # want fraction above* 1.64 SE
      mean = true_effect,  # mean of sampling distribution
      sd = se,             # sd of sampling distribution
      lower.tail = FALSE)  # fraction above, not below
```
