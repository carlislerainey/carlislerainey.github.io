### Graduate

- PSC 531: Examines the normal-linear model in detail, as well as some of its variants. Includes discussion of linking statistical models and substantive theory, estimating normal linear regression models, working with the inferences, generating confidence intervals to reflect the uncertainty in the point estimates of interest, and creating nice graphics to make your points in a compelling and honest manner.
- PSC 631: Examines many extensions to the normal-linear model, focusing mainly on maximum likelihood estimation. Includes discussion of linking statistical models and substantive theory, estimating a range of statistical models, working with the inferences, generating confidence intervals to reflect the uncertainty in the point estimates of interest, and creating nice graphics to make your points in a compelling and honest manner.
