Most political science research is “greatly underpowered” (Arel-Bundock et al. 2022).Here’s the idea:\n\nPower equals \\(1 - \\Phi_{std}\\left( 1.64 - \\frac{\\tau}{SE} \\right)\\), where \\(\\Phi_{std}(z)\\) is the standard normal CDF (as found in a standard \\(z\\) table), \\(SE\\) is the standard error of the estimated treatment effect, and \\(\\tau\\) is the treatment effect.\n\n\nThis rule allows us to connect statistical power to the familiar \\(z\\) table in the appendices of many statistics textbooks or the pnorm() function in R. But, more importantly, it drives home an important intuition—power is determined by the key ratio \\(\\frac{\\tau}{SE}\\). To estimate power, we must make an informed assumption about the effect of interest and a good prediction of standard error of the estimate. Further, when we consider changes to the experimental design and the consequences for statistical power, it can be helpful to think about the numerator or the denominator of the key ratio \\(\\frac{\\tau}{SE}\\): How do you make the effect as large as possible? And how do you make the estimate as precise as possible?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Key Tasks\n\n\n\n\nMake the effect as large as possible.\nMake the estimate as precise as possible."

However, the list is also helpful for making sure that we’ve thought through the ways to maximize power. It’s a wonderful paper well worth a careful read for folks who run experiments or read experimental work.\nI’m going to borrow his list and connect the action items to statistical power.\nKane arranges his list into seven “alternative explanations” for null results, which we might think of as “potential power leakages.” I recreated a version of Kane’s table (Table 1 in his paper) that contains each action item to consider. I’ve kept Kane’s labeling for the various categories, but taken some liberties in collapsing some of the action items.3\n3 He breaks his suggestions into to columns for the current study and future studies. For my purposes, these can be collapsed.The table below lists all of Kane’s categories and action items and notes the pathway through which this stop might increase statistical power.

It’s easy to feel lost without any guidance on what effects are reasonable to look for, so we might feel tempted to use a small pilot study to estimate the treatment effect and then use that estimate in our power analysis. This is a bad idea because the estimate of the treatment effect from a pilot study is too uncertain for a power analysis.2 Leon, Davis, and Kraemer (2011) and Albers and Lakens (2018) discuss this problem in more detail.3\n2 The estimate of the treatment effect from a well-powered study might be too noisy as well.3 Perugini, Gallucci, and Costantini (2014) offer a potential solution if it’s important to estimate the treatment effect from pilot data, though their approach is data-hungry and very conservative.

    "text": "Pilot data can be used to predict the standard error\nWhile pilot data might not be useful for estimating the treatment effect, pilot data are useful for estimating the standard error of the planned study. Given that power is a function of the ratio of the treatment effect and the standard error, it’s important to have a good prediction of the standard error. Further, the noisiness of this estimated standard error is predictable, so it’s easy to nudge the estimate slightly to obtain a conservative prediction.\nIn political science, it’s common to run pilot studies with, say, 100-200 respondents before a full-sized study of, say, 1,000 respondents. It can be very helpful to use these pilot data to confirm any preliminary power calculations.\nHere are two helpful rules:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicting the SE in the planned study using pilot data\n\n\n\nWe can use pilot data to predict the standard error of the estimated treatment effect in a planned study. Conservatively, the standard error will be about \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{n^{pilot}}{n^{planned}}}\\ \\left\\lbrack \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n^{pilot}}} + 1 \\right) \\cdot {\\widehat{SE}}_{\\widehat{\\tau}}^{pilot} \\right\\rbrack\\), where \\(n^{pilot}\\) is the number of respondents per condition in the pilot data, \\(SE_{\\widehat{\\tau}}^{pilot}\\) is the estimated standard error using the pilot data, and \\(n^{planned}\\) is the number of respondents per condition in the planned study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicting the required sample size in the planned study using pilot data\n\n\n\nWe can use pilot data to conservatively predict the sample size we will need in a planned study. For 80% power to detect the treatment effect \\(\\widetilde{\\tau}\\), we will (conservatively) need about \\(n^{pilot} \\cdot \\left\\lbrack \\frac{2.5}{\\widetilde{\\tau}} \\cdot \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n^{pilot}}} + 1 \\right) \\cdot {\\widehat{SE}}_{\\widehat{\\tau}}^{pilot} \\right\\rbrack^{2}\\) respondents per condition, where \\(n^{pilot}\\) is the number of respondents per condition in the pilot data and \\(SE_{\\widehat{\\tau}}^{pilot}\\) is the estimated standard error using the pilot data.\n\n\nNote that the factor \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n^{pilot}}} + 1\\) nudges the predicted standard error in a conservative direction. See this working paper for more details.\nWe can use the predicted standard error to find the minimum detectable effect (for 80% power) or the power (for a given treatment effect). Or we can use the pilot data to estimate the required sample size (for 80% power to detect a given treatment effect.)\n\nThe setting\nLet’s imagine a setting where a study with 1,000 respondents has 80% power to detect an average treatment effect of 1 unit. I’m imagining that we’re using linear regression with robust standard errors to test the hypothesis that the average treatment effect is positive (aka Welch’s t-test).

Because these required sample sizes are conservative, they tend to be too large—but by how much? For pilots with 60 respondents per condition, the sample sizes tend to be about 30% too large. This means that researchers could have obtained 80% power with 1,000 respondents but instead used 1,300 respondents.\nIn my view, this 30% waste is not particularly concerning. It’s relatively small and the statistical power will still be less than 90% even if the sample size is increased by 30%.\nBut most importantly, almost all of the sample sizes exceed what we need for 80% power.\n\n# compute features of the sample sizes\nss %&gt;%\n  group_by(n_pilot) %&gt;%\n  mutate(waste = ss_cons/n_planned - 1) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_waste = scales::percent(mean(waste), accuracy = 1), \n            pct_too_small = scales::percent(mean(ss_cons &lt; 500), accuracy = 1)) %&gt;%\n  rename(`Respondents per condition in pilot study` = n_pilot,\n         `Average waste (needed 1,000 respondents and used 1,300 means waste is 30%)` = avg_waste, \n         `Percent of sample sizes that produce less than 80% power` = pct_too_small) %&gt;%\n  tinytable::tt()\n\n \n\n  \n    \n    \n    tinytable_sghpfcv67rch2nmchm9v\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                Respondents per condition in pilot study\n                Average waste (needed 1,000 respondents and used 1,300 means waste is 30%)\n                Percent of sample sizes that produce less than 80% power\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                   10\n                  75%\n                  7%\n                \n                \n                   30\n                  41%\n                  4%\n                \n                \n                   60\n                  29%\n                  3%\n                \n                \n                   90\n                  24%\n                  3%\n                \n                \n                  150\n                  18%\n                  3%"

In this situation, there would be few parties whether the electoral institutions were permissive or not. Second, it could be the case that the electoral system is not permissive. In this situation, there would be a small number of parties even if the demand for political parties were high. Only a polity characterized by both a high degree of social heterogeneity and a highly permissive electoral system is expected to produce a large number of parties. (p. 683)\n\nThus, they expect that electoral institutions won’t matter in socially homogeneous systems.

    "text": "Final thoughts\n\n{marginaleffects} is a great package (Arel-Bundock 2024). I think it’s the first package in which the syntax matches the way I think about computing quantities of interest. That said, this is just my first try at it. But I’m very impressed so far.\nThe {marginaleffects} book Model to Meaning has a whole chapter on equivalence tests. My only caution is that there is a mismatch between 95% confidence intervals and equivalence tests. By default, {marginaleffects} reports a 95% CI, even when producing a p-value for an equivalence test. However, the 90% confidence interval correspondents to a size-5% equivalence test. So if you’re using {marginaleffects} to do equivalence tests, I recommend setting conf_level = 0.90.3\nFor a more recent example, Jares and Malhotra (2024) discusses negligible effects and hypothesis tests in a way that I find clear and compelling. It’s an excellent model to follow. See pp. 12-13. They “show that improved compensation outcomes had negligible impacts on Republican farmers’ midterm turnout and campaign contributions, even though such variation in benefits significantly affected farmers’ propensity to view the intervention as helpful.”\n\n\n\n\n3 I would make a similar point about one-sided tests as well, but that’s less correct, because it should be a one-sided 95% CI."

But large Monte Carlo simulations (or perhaps bootstraps), small differences might add up to a substantial time difference.\nHere, I benchmark the two packages for fitting logistic regression models with Firth’s penalty in a small sample–the results might not generalize to a larger sample. The data set comes from Weisiger (2014) (see ?crdata::weisiger2014). It has only 35 observations.\nYou can find the benchmarking code as a GitHub Gist."

    "text": "Dynamic Plot\nThe static plot above is nice, but doesn’t convey an appropriate sense of randomness or “you don’t know what you’ll get this time.” To convey this feeling, I like to add dynamics. In particular, I like a confidence interval that’s moving and you’re not sure if it will cover zero or not. This conveys the sense that “something bad might happen” with each draw. Even though only about 10 of the 50 confidence intervals will cross zero, you feel the danger on all 50 simulations.\nIn designing this plot, two features are in tension:\n\nThe plot conveys the ideas.\nThe code is easy to update and understand.\n\nIn the past, I’ve prioritized making the plot look exactly like I want. But there are concrete downsides to using hacky solutions—using functions in ways not intended. The code is brittle and difficult. For examples that clearly convey the ideas, see Presidential Plinko and this “raindrop” plot. These are great ways to convey the randomness, but producing these plots requires some “tedious” coding.\nWith this code, I tried to illustrate the concept well while avoid hacky solutions to minor problems. This makes the code easier to understand, change, and update.\nFirst, let’s start by creating the data frame to plot. We need to make two small changes to the data frame above. These are both hacks, but worth it.\n\nAdd a dummy row to the data frame to trick gganimate into starting with an empty plot.\nAdd a grouping variable to indicate the states for the transitions. This is simply a row ID variable.\n\n\n\nCode\n# load packages\nlibrary(gganimate)\n\n# add two things to the data frame of confidence intervals\n# 1. an initial row with study_id = 1 and est = NA so that \n#    the plot starts empty (gganimate would start with the \n#    first observation in place otherwise).\n# 2. a group variable that defines the row. This is the same\n#    as the study_id, except the dummy row from (1) and the \n#    actual first row have different groups.\nanimate_data &lt;- bind_rows(\n  tibble(study_id = 1, est = NA),  # study_id = 1, est = NA\n  ests                             # combine dummy row with ests data frame from above\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(group = 1:n())            # group (row index)\n\n\nNow let’s plot the confidence intervals much like above, except with expanded scales to give some more room for movement.\n\n\nCode\n# same ggplot, except three annotated changes\n1gg_exp &lt;- ggplot(animate_data, aes(x = est,\n                         y = study_id, \n                         xmin = est - 1.64*se, \n                         xmax = est + 1.64*se, \n                         color = reject_null, \n2                         group = group)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = true_effect, \n             linetype = \"dotted\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_errorbarh(height = 0) + \n  geom_rug(sides = \"b\", \n           aes(x = est - 1.64*se, color = NULL), \n           alpha = 0.5, \n           length = unit(0.025, \"npc\")) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#d95f02\", \"Yes\" = \"#1b9e77\")) +  \n  theme_bw() +\n    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank()) + \n  labs(x = \"Estimate and 90% Confidence Interval\",\n       y = \"Study ID\", \n       color = \"Reject Null?\", \n       caption = \"Rug shows distribution of lower bound of confidence interval.\n                  Solid lines shows zero.\n                  Dotted line shows the true effect.\") + \n  # new scales here\n3  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(add = c(0.6, 1))) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(add = 2))\n  \n\n# print plot\nprint(gg_exp)\n\n\n\n1\n\nUse dataset with group variable.\n\n2\n\nSet group explicitly.\n\n3\n\nExpand x- and y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s add the animation. I like the confidence intervals to be shooting toward zero. This gives the feeling that “it might cross!” and makes the fear of a failed study real for each simulation.\n\n\nCode\n# add dyamics to the plot\n1anim &lt;- gg_exp +\n2  transition_states(states = group) +\n  # how points enter\n3  enter_drift(x_mod = 2) +\n4  enter_grow() +\n5  enter_recolor(color = \"black\") +\n6  ease_aes(color = \"exponential-in\") +\n  # how points exit/remain\n7  exit_fade(alpha = 0.3) +\n8  shadow_mark(alpha = 0.3)\n\n# make magic happen!\nanimate(anim, duration = n_studies, fps = 10, \n        height = 6, width = 8, units = \"in\", res = 150)\n\n\n\n1\n\n‘gg’ is created earlier. It’s the plot we want to make dynamic.\n\n2\n\nThe transition_states() function from gganimate creates an animation transitioning between different states of the data. In this case, the argument states is set to group. This makes each group (each row in the data frame animate_data) appear in the plot, one at a time.\n\n3\n\nThe enter_drift() function describes how new data points enter the frame. x_mod = 2 makes new data enter by drifting along the x-axis 2 points from the right of their ending position.\n\n4\n\nThe enter_grow() function describes how new data points enter the frame. In this case, it makes them will grow from a size of 0 to their ending size.\n\n5\n\nThe enter_recolor() function again describes how new data points should enter the frame. Here, it makes the points and CIs change the color from black to their ending color as they appear. I want the final color to be a bit of a surprise, so I start them as black.\n\n6\n\nThe ease_aes() function determines how the aesthetics of the points change over the transitions. color = \"exponential-in\" means the color change will be at an exponential rate at the start of the transition. This makes the color change really fast at the end of the transition to maintain the surprise of the result.\n\n7\n\nThe exit_fade() function describes how data points leave the frame. alpha = 0.3 specifies that points will fade out to 30% transparency when they exit (when the next data point reaches its position).\n\n8\n\nshadow_mark() function keeps past data points in the frame. alpha = 0.3 sets the transparency of the shadow marks to 30% to match the exit_fade() transparency."

    "text": "Summary\nThe dynamic plot above is a good tool to help students understand that confidence intervals can quite easily include values on the wrong side of zero. Stated differently, it’s easy for a hypothesis test to fail to reject the null (when the null is wrong). Their intuition suggests that the test should tell you the correct answer.\nThe exercises above (appropriately) undermine their trust in hypothesis tests. I want them to feel the riskiness of poorly-powered experiments that consistently nestle confidence intervals right up against zero. I want them ready to work hard to avoid that risk—to make sure they have statistical power. Hopefully, they see that carefully building power into your experiment isn’t a task, it’s the task of experimental design.\nAs a concluding example, here’s the same dynamic plot for a study with about 98% power. Notice how “safe” this study feels compared to the one above with 80% power.

    "section": "Intepreting a Failure to Reject",
    "text": "Intepreting a Failure to Reject\nA failure to reject means that the data “would not be unusual under the null hypothesis.” This does not imply that you should conclude the data are only consistent with the null. Indeed, there is a sharp asymmetry in hypothesis testing. I describe this in my 2014 AJPS:\n\nPolitical scientists commonly interpret a lack of statistical significance (i.e., a failure to reject the null) as evidence for a negligible effect (Gill 1999), but this approach acts as a broken compass… If the sample size is too small, the researcher often concludes that the effect is negligible even though the data are also consistent with large, meaningful effects. This occurs because the small sample leads to a large confidence interval, which is likely to contain both “no effect” and large effects.\n\nGill (1999)4 describes this more forcefully:\n4 Gill, Jeff. 1999. “The Insignificance of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing.” Political Research Quarterly 52(3): 647-674.\nWe teach graduate students to be very careful when describing the occurrence of not rejecting the null hypothesis. This is because failing to reject the null hypothesis does not rule out an infinite number of other competing research hypotheses. Null hypothesis significance testing is asymmetric: if the test statistic is sufficiently atypical given the null hypothesis then the null hypothesis is rejected, but if the test statistic is insufficiently atypical given the null hypothesis then the null hypothesis is not accepted. This is a double standard: H1 is held innocent until proven guilty and Ho is held guilty until proven innocent (Rozeboom 1960)…\n\n\nThere are two problems that develop as a result of asymmetry. The first is a misinterpretation of the asymmetry to assert that finding a non-statistically significant difference or effect is evidence that it is equal to zero or nearly zero. Regarding the impact of this acceptance error Schmidt (1996: 126) asserts that this: “belief held by many researchers is the most devastating of all to the research enterprise.” This acceptance of the null hypothesis is damaging because it inhibits the exploration of competing research hypotheses. The second problem pertains to the correct interpretation of failing to reject the null hypotheses. Failing to reject the null hypothesis essentially provides almost no information about the state of the world. It simply means that given the evidence at hand one cannot make an assertion about some relationship: all you can conclude is that you can’t conclude that the null was false (Cohen 1962).\n\nThere are many incorrect, but somewhat innocent interpretations of p-values. Interpreting a lack of statistical significance as evidence for the null is incorrect and wildly misleading in many cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Point\n\n\n\nA non-statistically significant difference is not evidence that an effect is equal to zero or nearly zero. Interpreting a non-statistically significant effect otherwise is “devastating.”"

Obtaining \\(p &gt; 0.05\\) will not be an “error” because you won’t make a strong claim that the research hypothesis is wrong. Instead, you will simply admit that you failed to uncover evidence against the null. Failing to uncover evidence isn’t an error.\nIndeed, Jones and Tukey (2000)5 write:\n5 Jones, Lyle V., and John W. Tukey. 2000. “A Sensible Formulation of the Significance Test.” Psychological Methods 5(4): 411-414.\nA conclusion is in error only when it is “a reversal,” when it asserts one direction while the (unknown) truth is the other direction. Asserting that the direction is not yet established may constitute a wasted opportunity, but it is not an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Point\n\n\n\nFailing to uncover evidence isn’t an “error,” it is a “wasted effort.”\n\n\nThis is worth emphasizing in a different way. Tests are not magical tools that tell you which hypothesis is correct. Instead, tests summarize the evidence against the null. There are two critical pieces to “evidence against the null”: (1) the amount of evidence and (2) whether the evidence is against the null. If you buy your own argument that the null is false (surely you do!), then (2) is taken care of. Only the amount of evidence remains, and you–the researcher–choose the amount of evidence to supply."

    "text": "The Implication for Power Calculations\nThis perspective helps motivate power calculations. By their design, tests control the error rate in certain situations (when then null is correct). You do not need to worry about Type I errors. First, the test controls the error rate under the null. Second, you are pretty sure the null is wrong (see your theory section).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Point\n\n\n\nThe hypothesis test takes care of the the Type I error rate. If you choose a properly-sized test, you don’t need to worry about those errors any more.\n\n\nIf you aren’t worried about Type I errors, what are you worried about? They only thing left to worry about is wasting your time and money. Statistical power is the chance not of wasting your time and money.\nPower isn’t a secondary quantity that you compute for thoroughness or in anticipation of a comment from Reviewer 2. Power is something that you build for yourself.\nStatisticians talk a lot about Type I errors because that’s their contribution. It’s your job to bring the power.\nAnd importantly, power is under your control. Kane provides a rich summary of ways to increase the power of your experiment. At a minimum, you have brute force control through sample size.\nPower isn’t an ancillary concern, it’s the entire game from the very beginning of the planning stage. It should be at the forefront of the researchers mind from the very beginning. You should want the power as high as possible.6\n6 I hear that 80% is the standard, but I’m pretty uncomfortable spending dozens of hours and thousands of dollars running for a 1 in 5 chance of wasting my time. I want that chance as close to zero as I can get it. I want power close to 100%. 99% power and 80% power might both seem “high” or “acceptable,” but these are not the same. 80% power means 1 in 5 studies fail. 99% power means that 1 in 100 studies fail.You have to supply a test overwhelming evidence to consistently reject the null. Careful power calculations help you make sure you succeed in this war against the null.\nPower isn’t about Type S and M errors (Gelman and Carlin 2014)7. Power is about you protecting yourself from a failed study. And that seems like a protection worth pursuing carefully.8\n7 Gelman, Andrew, and John Carlin. “Beyond Power Calculations: Assessing Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) Errors.” Perspectives on Psychological Science 9(6): 641-651.8 Of course it’s also about Type S and M errors, but those are discipline-level concerns. I’m talking about your incentives as a researcher."

    "text": "Background\nIn this post, I address confidence intervals that are nestled right up against zero.1 These intervals indicate that an estimate is “barely” significant. I want to be clear: “barely significant” is still significant, so you should still reject the null hypothesis.2\n1 This is the second post in a series. In my previous post, I mentioned two new papers that have me thinking about power: Arel-Bundock et al.’s “Quantitative Political Science Research Is Greatly Underpowered” and Kane’s “More Than Meets the ITT: A Guide for Investigating Null Results”. Go check out that post and those papers if you haven’t.2 I’m focusing on confidence intervals here because inference from confidence intervals is a bit more intuitive (see Rainey 2014 and Rainey 2015. In the cases I discuss, whether one checks whether the p-value is less than 0.05 or checks that confidence interval contains zero are equivalent.But I want to address a feeling that can come along with a confidence interval nestled right up against zero. A feeling of victory. It seems like a perfectly designed study. You rejected the null and collected just enough data to do it.\nBut instead, it should feel like a near-miss. Like an accident narrowly avoided. A confidence interval nestled right up against zero indicates that one of two things has happened: either you were (1) unlucky or (2) under-powered.\nBecause “unlucky” is always a possibility, we can’t learn much from a particular confidence interval, but we can learn a lot from a literature. A literature with well-powered studies produces confidence intervals that often fall far from zero. A well-powered literature does not produce confidence intervals that consistently nestle up against zero. Under-powered studies, though, do tend to produce confidence intervals that nestle right up against zero."

    "text": "A Simulation\nI’m going to explore the behavior of confidence intervals with a little simulation. In this simulation, I’m going to assert a standard error rather than create the standard error endogenously through sample size, etc. I use a true effect size of 0.5 and standard errors of 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.15 to create studies with 25%, 50%, 80%, and 95% power, respectively.3 I think of 80% as “minimally-powered” and 95% as “well-powered.”\n3 I’m ignoring how to choose the true effect, estimate the standard error, and compute power. For now, I’m placing all this behind the curtain. See Daniël Lakens’ book [Improving Your Statistical Inferences] for discussion (h/t Bermond Scoggins).I’m using a one-sided test (hypothesizing a positive effect), so I’ll use 90% confidence intervals with arms that are 1.64 standard errors wide. Let’s simulate some estimates from each of our four studies and compute their confidence intervals. I simulate 5,000 confidence intervals to explore below.\n\n\nCode\n# load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# create a parameter for the true effect\ntrue_effect &lt;- 0.5 # just assumed by me\n\n# create a data frame of standard errors (with approximate power)\nse_df &lt;- tribble(\n  ~se,    ~pwr,\n  0.5,    \"about 25% power\",\n  0.3,    \"about 50% power\",\n  0.2,    \"about 80% power\",\n  0.15,   \"about 95% power\"\n)\n\n# create function to simulate estimates for each standard error\nsimulate_estimates &lt;- function(se, pwr) {\n  tibble(\n    est = rnorm(n_cis, mean = true_effect, sd = se),\n    se = se,\n    pwr = pwr\n  )\n}\n\n# simulate the estimates, compute the confidence intervals, and wrangle\nn_cis &lt;- 5000  # the number of cis to create\nci_df &lt;- se_df %&gt;% \n  # simulate estimates\n  pmap_dfr(simulate_estimates) %&gt;%\n  # compute confidence intervals\n  mutate(lwr = est - 1.64*se, \n         upr = est + 1.64*se) %&gt;%\n  # summarize the location of the confidence interval\n  mutate(result = case_when(lwr &lt; 0 ~ \"Not significant\",\n                            lwr &lt; se ~ \"Nestled against zero\",\n                            lwr &gt;= se~ \"Not nestled against zero\"))\n\n\nNow let’s quickly confirm my power calculations by computing the proportion of confidence intervals to the right of zero. These are about right. In a later post, I’ll describe how I think about computing these quantities.\n\n\nCode\n# confirm power calculations\nci_df %&gt;%\n  group_by(se, pwr) %&gt;%\n  summarize(sim_pwr = 1 - mean(result == \"Not significant\"),\n            sim_pwr = scales::percent(sim_pwr, accuracy = 1)) %&gt;%\n    select(SE = se, \n         Power = pwr,\n         `Percent Significant` = sim_pwr) %&gt;%\n  kableExtra::kable(format = \"markdown\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSE\nPower\nPercent Significant\n\n\n\n\n0.15\nabout 95% power\n96%\n\n\n0.20\nabout 80% power\n80%\n\n\n0.30\nabout 50% power\n52%\n\n\n0.50\nabout 25% power\n26%"

    "text": "What Do Confidence Intervals from Well-Powered Studies Look Like?\nNow let’s see what these confidence intervals look like. 5,000 is too many to plot, so I sample 25. But I applied the statistical significance filter first. This mimics the publication process and makes the plots a little easier to compare. My argument doesn’t depend on this filter, though.\nI plotted these 100 intervals below4\n4 4 studies x 25 simulated intervals per study = 100 intervals.There are three important vertical lines in these plots.\n\nThe solid line indicates zero. All confidence intervals are above zero because I applied the significance filter.\nThe dotted line indicates one standard error above zero. This varies across panels because the standard error varies across panels.\nThe dashed line indicates the true effect of 0.5. Because I applied the significance filter, the lower-powered studies are consistently over-estimating the true effect.\n\nThe intervals are green when the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval falls within one standard error of zero—that’s my definition of “nestled up against zero.” The intervals are orange when the lower bound falls further than one standard error above zero.\nNotice how low-powered studies tend to nestle their confidence intervals right up against zero. Almost all of the confidence intervals from the study with 25% power are nestled right up against zero. Very few of the confidence intervals from the study with 95% power are nestled up against zero.\nAgain, you should apply this standard to a literature. You should not apply this standard to a particular study because even well-powered studies sometimes produce confidence intervals that nestle up against zero. But when you start to see confidence intervals consistently falling close to zero, you should start to assume that the literature uses under-powered studies and that the estimates in that literature are inflated due to Type M errors (Gelman and Stern 2014).\n\n\nCode\ngg_df &lt;- ci_df %&gt;%\n  filter(lwr &gt; 0) %&gt;% # apply significance filter \n  # sample 25 intervals (from those that are significant)\n  group_by(se, pwr) %&gt;%\n  sample_n(25) %&gt;%\n  # create id (ordered by estimate value)\n  group_by(se, pwr) %&gt;%\n  arrange(est) %&gt;%\n  mutate(ci_id = 1:n())\n  \nggplot(gg_df, aes(x = est, xmin = lwr, xmax = upr, y = ci_id,\n                    color = result)) + \n  facet_wrap(vars(pwr), ncol = 1, scales = \"free_x\") + \n  geom_vline(data = se_df, aes(xintercept = se), linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = true_effect, linetype = \"dashed\") + \n  geom_errorbarh(height = 0) + \n  geom_point() + \n  scale_color_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = 2) + \n  theme_bw() + \n  labs(x = \"Estimate and 90% CI\",\n       y = NULL,\n       color = \"Result\")"

    "section": "Starting Point: The Sampling Distribution",
    "text": "Starting Point: The Sampling Distribution\nWhen you run one experiment, you realize one of many possible patterns of randomization. This particular realization produces a single estimate of the treatment effect from a distribution of possible estimates. The distribution of possibilities is called a “sampling distribution.”\nThus, we can think of the estimate as a random variable and its distribution as the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution is key to everything I do in this post, so let’s spend some time with it.\nLet’s imagine that we did the exact same study 50 times. Let’s say that we computed a difference-in-means in dollars ($) donated.1 I refer to this difference-in-means as the estimated treatment effect. It is the estimate of the average treatment effect (in $). This estimate will vary across the many possible patterns of randomization because each pattern puts different respondents in the treatment and control group.\n1 I just want an easy-to-use unit here, and dollars meets that criteria. Other units work fine, too.We can visualize this with ggnaminate. We can imagine each iteration of the study as producing a particular estimate. We continue to repeat the study and collect the estimates. Eventually, we can produce a histogram from this collection of estimates. This histogram represents the sampling distribution and is fundamental to the calculations that follow.

We call the standard deviation of the sampling distribution the standard error or SE.\n\nFor our purposes, then, we can describe the sampling distribution as normally distributed with an assumed mean and SD. The mean is the assumed true effect and the SD is the well-predicted SE.\nThis is the key claim: In order to build power into your experiment, you must build certain properties into the sampling distribution.\nThe design of your experiment will not affect the normality of the sampling distribution, but it will change the true effect and the SE. Changing the true effect and the SE will change the power."

    "text": "Thinking about True Effect and Standard Error as Targets\nI’m leaving aside how to predict the standard error of the experiment or choose the true effect. This post is about the target standard error and true effect.\nPredicting the standard error is a mechanical process mixed with a little guesswork.2 Choose a true effect is a mostly substantive decision.3\n2 I’ll suggest two methods I like. First, use \\(\\text{predicted SE} = \\frac{\\text{SD of same outcome in different data set}}{0.5 \\sqrt{\\text{sample size}}}\\). I like to confirm this estimate with a small pilot. I sample observations from this pilot data set, run the full analysis, and confirm that my prediction is close, and make any needed adjustments.3 Cyrus Samii likes to use the MME, I like a conservatively choosen guess of what the effect actually is.But instead of talking about a target power, I like to talk about a target standard error (given a true effect) or a target true effect (given a standard error)—power is just not a very intuitive quantity.\nTo understand how the true effect and the SE relate to power, we need to introduce the confidence interval."

    "section": "Testing with Confidence Intervals",
    "text": "Testing with Confidence Intervals\nI like to use 90% confidence intervals to test hypotheses (see Rainey 2014 and Rainey 2015). In short, 90% confidence intervals correspond to one-tailed tests with size 0.05 and equivalence tests with size 0.05.] The formula for a 90% CI is \\(\\text{estimate} \\pm 1.64\\text{SE}\\). That is, we put “arms” around our estimate—one to the left and another to the right. Each arm is 1.64 standard errors long.\nI’ll assume we have a one-sided research hypothesis that suggests a positive effect. If the lower bound (\\(\\text{estimate} - 1.64\\text{SE}\\)) is less than zero, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If this lower bound is greater than zero, then we reject the null hypothesis.4\n4 This is equivalent to a z-test in a standard hypothesis testing framework using a p-value of less than 0.05 as the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.This focus on testing rather than estimation changes the nature of the sampling distribution. Rather than an estimate along a continuous range, we get a binary outcome: either (1) reject the null hypothesis or (2) fail to reject the null hypothesis.\nBut the sampling distribution of estimates and the associated outcomes of tests are closely related. In particular, the logic of the test implies that *if the estimate falls less than 1.64 SEs above zero, we cannot reject the null.\nWe can reconstruct the figure above using this logic. Rather than plot the points continuously along the x-axis, we can color the points (and now error bars) according to whether the lower bound falls above zero or not. And we can use a bar plot showing the number of rejections and non-rejections.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(magick)\n\n# gif pars\nduration &lt;- 24 # must be even\nfps &lt;- 25\nnframes &lt;- duration*fps\nscale &lt;- 2.5\nwidth &lt;- 8\nheight &lt;- 6\nres &lt;- 125\n\n# study parameters\ntrue_effect &lt;- 1\nse &lt;- 0.4\n\n# number of times to repeat the study\nn_studies &lt;- 50 # nframes\n\n# create a data frame of confidence intervals\nests &lt;- tibble(study_id = 1:n_studies, \n               est = c(rnorm(n_studies, true_effect, se))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(reject_null = ifelse(est - 1.64*se &gt; 0, \"Yes\", \"No\"),\n         lwr = est - 1.64*se,\n         upr = est + 1.64*se)\n\n# add two things to the data frame of confidence intervals\n# 1. an initial row with study_id = 1 and est = NA so that \n#    the plot starts empty (gganimate would start with the \n#    first observation in place otherwise).\n# 2. a group variable that defines the row.

To increase the treatment effect, you can:\n\nIncrease attentiveness.\nEnsure that respondents are not pre-treated.\nWrite strong treatments or “hit them between the eyes” (Kuklinski et al. 2000).\n\nTo decrease the standard error, you can:\n\nIncrease the sample size.\nUse multiple measurements for the outcome.\nUse a pre-post design (Clifford, Sheagley, and Piston 2022)."

This has an important implication.\n7 Find this by adding 1.64 to -qnorm(0.2).A researcher can lower the risk of a failed study from about 1 in 5 (80% power) to about 1 in 50 (98% power) by increasing the ratio from 2.48 to 3.64. This requires increasing the treatment effect by about 50% or shrinking the standard error by about 33%. Stated differently, if you are careless and let your treatment effect fall by 33% or let your standard error increase by 50%, then your risk of a failed study increases 10-fold! Small differences can matter a lot.\nThe implication is this: when you are on the cusp of a well-powered study (about 80% power), then small increases in the ratio have a disproportionate impact on your risk of a failed study."

In graduate school, I had teaching responsibilities, RA duties, readings for seminars, homework for methods classes, preliminary exams, and administrative tasks. All of these tasks are important.

It’s easy to put off writing to prepare a lecture (or write a blog post)."

Consistency is key.3\nAvoid writing outside this window. Set your window so that your window is “enough.”\nTake breaks. I take long breaks from writing. But these are intentional and planned.4\nFamily permitting, I think it’s helpful to spend a little while pushing the projects forward on the weekends, just to keep the momentum up.5\n\n3 Two hours works really well for me. My productivity degrades quickly after two hours, so it’s best to move on to less taxing tasks. But it takes me a while to get warmed up, so I need to keep moving while I’ve got momentum.4 An unfortunate outcome is not writing and being stressed about not writing.5 Just 15 minutes is great. This slot is perfect for proof-reading.I admit that I deviate from the strategy above (and not always intentionally). But I’ve been at this long enough to know that a regular routine works really well for me."

Most students need some time before they’re ready to jump into the technical details a solo project, but there are always things to do.\nIf you can’t identify a specific task to work on, here are some resources to help you brainstorm.\n\nPlan and organize. Start by reading How to Write a Lot. Perhaps read Getting Things Done. Perhaps read Air & Light & Time & Space or Writing for Social Scientists.\nRead “Publication, Publication” and the updates.\nBefore you can jump into a project, you need to know the literature. Spend some writing time exploring literatures that you might want to contribute to. What interests you most? The Annual Review of Political Science is a valuable resource.\nOnce you have a specific topic of interest, you need to learn that literature. You can spend dozens of “writing” sessions reading and taking notes. I strongly encourage you to read and take notes systematically, as Raul Pacheco-Vega suggests using a spreadsheet, Elaine Campbell suggests a similar method, and Katherine Firth suggests a using Cornell notes.\nTanya Golash-Boza lists ten ways to write everyday if you’ve got a paper in-progress."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Rainey and McCaskey (2021), Kelly McCaskey and I offer a accessible and practical (re)introduction to Firth’s penalized maximum likelihood estimator that (1) corrects the small sample bias and (2) reduces the excessive variance of the usual maximum likelihood estimator.\nBelow, I bookmark other references that might be helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m sure there are embarrassing omissions. If you see an omission, please let me know (self-promotion is encouraged, especially not-yet-published papers).\n\n\n\nThis Stack Exchange answer gives a brief, but careful explanation of Firth’s logit. If you’re looking for a quick explanation, start here.\n\nThe Two Main Papers\n\nFirth (1993) originally introduced the idea. Kelly and I draw mostly on this paper—it’s a wonderful paper.\nKosmidis and Firth (2021) follow-up with additional theoretical results that are relevant for the estimator as used in practice since 1993. This happened to come out while our paper was working its way through the publication process. Most importantly, they discuss the shrinkage property of the estimator, which is what Kelly and I highlight as under-appreciated (and really important!).\n\nFrom my perpective, these are the two main papers to refer to if you’re concerned about small sample bias in logistic regression models.\n\n\nExtensions\nBeyond these two main papers, there have been a few extensions. Zietkiewicz and Kosmidis (2023) talk about Firth’s logit in very large data sets. Cook, Hays, and Franzese (2018) make a good argument for using Firth’s estimator in panel data sets with binary outcomes and fixed effects. Sterzinger and Kosmidis (2023) apply these ideas to mixed models (or random effects models). Šinkovec et al. (2021) compare Firth’s approach to ridge regression, and suggest that Firth’s is superior in small or sparse data sets. Puhr et al. (2017) study Firth’s logit in the context of rare events and propose FLIC and FLAC as alternatives.\n\n\nApplications\n\nRöver et al. (2022) offer an application of Firth’s logit to clinical trials.\nTurner and Firth (2012) offer an application to Bradley-Terry models with the {BradleyTerry2} R package.\n\n\n\nSeparation and Finiteness\nI learned about Firth’s estimator from Zorn (2005), who follows Heinze and Schemper (2002) in suggesting it as a solution to separation. According to David Firth in this blog post, this is the application that stimulated interest in the approach after it went relatively unnoticed for a few years. (Great post, I highly recommend reading it!) This application piqued my interest in Firth’s estimator. Briefly, I think Firth’s default penalty might not be substantively reasonable in a given application (Rainey 2016) (see also Beiser-McGrath (2020)) and the usual likelihood ratio and score tests work well without the penalty (Rainey 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more on Firth’s logit, see Ioannis Kosmidis’ research page and Georg Heinz Google Scholar page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBeiser-McGrath, Liam F. 2020. “Separation and Rare Events.” Political Science Research and Methods 10 (2): 428–37. https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2020.46.\n\n\nCook, Scott J., Jude C.

The factor we used above—The factor \\(\\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n^{pilot}}} + 1 \\right)\\)—nudges the standard error to about the 2.5th percentile, so we can use that here, too.\n\n# number of bootstrap iterations\nn_bs &lt;- 10000\n\nbs_se &lt;- numeric(n_bs)  # a container\nfor (i in 1:n_bs){\n  # resample 367 observations from each condition\n  bs_data &lt;- robbins2_main %&gt;%\n    group_by(amplify) %&gt;%\n    sample_n(size = 367, replace = TRUE)\n  # run planned analysis\n  bs_fit &lt;- t.test(cong_overall ~ amplify, data = bs_data)\n  # grab se\n  bs_se[i] &lt;- bs_fit$stderr\n}\n\n# compute 2.5th percentile of power to obtain conservative estimate\npwr &lt;- 1 - pnorm(1.64 - 0.35/bs_se)\nquantile(pwr, probs = 0.025)\n\n     2.5% \n0.8199688 \n\n\nUsing the analytical approximation, we got 0.815 as a conservative estimate of power. The bootstrap gave us 0.820 as a conservative estimate. The actual power in the full study turned out to be about 0.843. (Remember, all of these power calculations are power to detected an effect of 0.35 points on the seven-point scale.)"

    "text": "Why does power matter to the researcher?\nYou are a clever theorist and hypothesize that X increases Y; then the null hypothesis is that X does not increase Y. You design an experiment and statistical test. You plan to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05. Two types of errors can occur.\nType I: First, you might incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. That is, the null is true, but your p-value is less than 0.05 and you reject it.\nType II: Second, you might incorrectly fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, the null is false (i.e., the research hypothesis is correct), but your p-value is greater than 0.05 and you do not reject the null.\nLet’s think more on this second “error.” You’ve paid all the costs of designing and fielding an experiment. But in the end, you cannot distinguish between your research hypothesis and the null hypothesis. This is a wasted opportunity. Researchers care about statistical power because they do not want to waste their time, effort, and money."

All relevant information is in the confidence interval. Caveat: power does change the meaning of “not significant,” but this information is in the CI.\nOthers’ perspective: Power matters greatly after running the experiment. Authors and reviewers dismiss papers without significant findings. This significance filter combined with low power causes published estimates to diverge from the truth."

    "section": "How can I compute statistical power?",
    "text": "How can I compute statistical power?\nTo compute statistical power, first ask: “for what effect?” Identify the range of substantively interesting effects and choose the smallest effect in this range. This is the smallest effect of substantive interest (SESOI). The experiment should be well-powered for the SESOI.\nFancy software can compute power for you, but I like simple rules of thumb. Experiments have:\n\n80% power to detect effects that are 2.5 times the standard error, and\n95% power to detect effects that are 3.3 times the standard error.\n\nAs a reader, you can simply multiply the reported standard errors by 2.5 and ask yourself: “is this effect substantively small?” If 2.5 times the reported standard error is a substantively large effect, then the experiment is underpowered.\nAs a researcher, you can predict the standard error of a simple two-group, difference-in-means comparison using \\(\\text{SE} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the outcome variable and \\(n\\) is the sample size per condition. You can obtain a suitable value of \\(\\sigma\\) from an existing study of the same outcome and population. Or from a pilot study, if you plan to use one. As a too-crude shortcut in a pinch, you might use range/4.\nRegression adjustment can increase power; it shrinks the standard error by a factor of about \\(\\sqrt{1 - R^2}\\), where \\(R^2\\) is the \\(R^2\\) of the regression of the predictors on the outcome variable. Unless predictors are highly predictive of the outcome, adjustment doesn’t matter much. However, in pre–post designs, the researcher measures the outcome before and after the treatment and adjusts for the pre-treatment measure. This shrinks the standard error at least 30%, typically 50%, and perhaps 70%. You can obtain a suitable value of \\(R^2\\) from a pilot study, if you have one."

    "text": "What should I read next?\nCohen (1988) provides the foundational introduction to power analysis; Cohen (1990) offers an engaging personal and historical perspective. DeGroot and Schervish (2010, ch. 9) and Casella and Berger (2002, ch. 8) provide a thorough technical discussion. Jones and Tukey (2000) discuss Type II errs as “wasted opportunities.”\nBloom (1995) offers a practical and intuitive approach using the minimum detectable effect. Rainey (2025) updates Bloom’s perspective. Greenland et al. (2016) offer an accessible discussion organized around potential misunderstandings. Cohen (1992), Lenth (2001), and Meyvis and van Osselaer (2018) also offer practical guides.\nRainey (2014), McCaskey and Rainey (2015), and Lakens, Scheel, and Isager (2018, see esp. pp. 261-263) discuss the SESOI. Lovakov and Agadullina (2021) offer empirical rules for effect sizes derived from social psychology. Leon, Davis, and Kraemer (2011) and Albers and Lakens (2018) explain why pilot data should not be used to estimate the effect for the power calculation, though Marco Perugini, Gallucci, and Costantini (2014) propose a conservative alternative.\nHoenig and Heisey (2001) explain why power should not be used for interpreting results. Gelman and Carlin (2014) explain the pernicious effects of filtering on statistical significance when power is low. Arel-Bundock et al. (2025) show that observed power in political science is very low. Ioannidis, Stanley, and Doucouliagos (2017) examine economics; Stanley, Carter, and Doucouliagos (2018) examine psychology.\nMeyvis and van Osselaer (2018) discuss regression adjustment in the context of experiments. Clifford, Sheagley, and Piston (2021) show huge boosts in power of the pre–post design; Jordan, Ollerenshaw, and Trexler (2025) validate their findings.\nLakens (2022) offers a broader perspective on sample size justification beyond statistical power. Blair et al. (2019) and Blair, Coppock, and Humphreys (2023) offer a useful conceptual framework and software for comprehensive evaluation of research designs."
